# Anti-Raid Documentation

This is the documentation for the Anti-Raid bot. To add a new book to the documentation, create a new folder in ``data/docs`` (here) and then add a ``meta.yaml`` file as per the below specs:

``name`` - The name of the book
``author`` - The author of the book (not currently used)

To add a new chapter to a book, create a new file in the book's folder. The first line starting with `#` will be treated as the title of the chapter. The rest of the file will be treated as the content of the chapter.
