# Permissions

Imagine. Imagine a discord bot which you could completely control. You could decide who can use any specific command, who can change the bot's settings, and who can even use the bot at all.

## Modes

Anti-Raid has two different modes for permission checks depending on how custom your needs are:

- ``Simple``: In simple mode, you just need to specify the exact permissions needed to run a command. This is the default mode.
- ``Template``: If you have more advanced needs, you can also use custom templates to determine if a user has the required permissions. See [`Templating`](/docs/guide/templating) for more information on how templating works.
