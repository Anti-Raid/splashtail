# Luau Ecosystem Integration Notes

At AntiRaid, we believe that bot developers should be able to access the best tools available to them. To this end, we have integrated some popular Luau libraries into our templating environment to provide a more powerful and flexible experience while taking into account security and stability of the bot. Below, we outline the libraries that are currently available for use in your Lua templates:

## Libraries

- [**@lune/datetime**](https://lune-org.github.io/docs/api-reference/datetime)
- [**@lune/regex**](https://lune-org.github.io/docs/api-reference/regex)
- [**@lune/serde**](https://lune-org.github.io/docs/api-reference/serde)

We do not claim ownership of these libraries or their trademarks whatsoever, nor do we provide any guarantees or warranties regarding their functionality. AntiRaid absolves all liability for any damages or losses incurred through the use of these libraries, both to the libraries owner and to AntiRaid itself.
