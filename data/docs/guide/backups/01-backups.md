# Backups

## What's backed up

Guild structure (roles/channels/name/icon/other settings), some messages (Discord has limits here) and attachments (within reasonable limits). 

## What's not backed up?

Members and bots. Note that for members, we have something coming up *soon* that may allow you to 'backup/restore' (with consent + regularly re-providing consent) members.

Note that new discord features may also not be backed up/restored immediately on release.
