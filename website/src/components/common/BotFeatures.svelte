    title="Customizable Backups"
>
    AntiRaid offers you with customizable <em>and</em> downloadable server backups 
    allowing you to both backup exactly what you need and control your server's data if you 
    want to. If the bot ever goes down like many others, fear not! AntiRaid offers Local Jobs 
    allowing you to continue backing up and restoring your server(s) locally from your computer. 
    It's your server and we believe you should be able to take control of it! That's our policy.

    title="Limits"
>
    With AntiRaid, you can setup limits to control exactly what your moderators can do through simple ratelimits.<br/><br/> 
    
    <strong>Note:</strong> Limits are NOT a subsitute for anti-nuke bots (like Wick) but rather complement them.

    title="User Friendly"
>
    Unlike most other bots, AntiRaid provides an API to perform many actions such as  
    managing backups/settings and exporting your data if you wish to switch out to avoid 
    vendor-locking.

    title="Advanced Infractions System"

    Our Advanced Infractions System allows you to easily make cases against a user for 
    violating rules, while being able to make it contain information such as moderator name, 
    allegation, reason, action and proof.
</Benefit>

    title="Audit Logging"

    Everytime a action occurs on your server, we will send a message to a specific channel to 
    help better protect your server against attackers.
